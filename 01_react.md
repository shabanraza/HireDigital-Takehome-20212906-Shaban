## React Test

For this test, you will be required to build a marketplace application in React. This application should be seeded with data from the `projects.json` file, and your task is to build an interface around it. Other json files may be included, but you are not required to make use of them.

Your requirements for this application:

1. Build a general product list page for buyers to find products. The product list should be searchable, filterable, and sortable. Paginate this list via an infinite scroll. 
2. Build a detail view for buyers, as well as an edit view for the seller of the item. As the initial data does not contain a seller, assign one accordingly in the initial data set.
3. Allow users to add new products.
4. Add a simple login/logout function. Use a user dropdown to change users. No authentication is required.
5. Track views and viewers of each product. Showcase this data to the seller.
6. You are not required to build a purchasing/checkout mechanism.

Code requirements:

1. You must use functional components and hooks.
2. You must use context to pass user data through components.
3. You must reduce unecessary re-rendering of components.
4. You may save data directly to the json file or through an in-browser database. Do not use an external database.

### How to submit your work

1. Save your work in a public github/gitlab git repository and share the repo link.
2. Provide instructions on how to run/start the application.
2. Deploy the application to a free static hosting service. Share the link for our review.

### How we will review your code

We will review your code based on structure, performance, and functionality.
