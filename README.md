## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- copy the repository url
- use git clone https://github.com/shabanraza/HireDigital-Takehome-20212906-Shaban.git
- go to project directory install dependency via `npm install` at root level
- then run `npm run dev` inside of project directory

By default, Repl.it runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the `.replit` file.
